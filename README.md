# Deep Q-Learning for Research Paper Recommendations

A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based recommendation system designed to suggest relevant research papers based on user-selected categories. The model uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn an effective policy that maximizes the relevance of recommended papers.

---

## Overview

This project applies Deep Q-Learning to build an intelligent agent capable of recommending high-quality academic research papers. By learning from experience, the agent is trained to optimize long-term rewards, providing users with meaningful paper suggestions aligned with their topics of interest.

---

## Approach

The system leverages a DQN-driven reinforcement learning pipeline. The recommendation agent is optimized through continuous interaction with its environment.

### State Representation
Each paper is encoded as a feature vector using:
- Title
- Abstract
- Research Category

### Action Space
The agent selects a subset of papers that best match the selected research category.

### Reward Mechanism
Rewards are based on the relevance of the recommended papers:
- Higher rewards for accurate category matches.
- Lower rewards for off-topic suggestions.

### Policy Learning
The DQN model refines its action-selection strategy over time through Q-learning, improving recommendation accuracy with each iteration.

## Network Design

- **Input Layer**  
  Accepts user-selected categories and the associated paper features.

- **Hidden Layers**  
  Composed of dense layers activated with ReLU to extract informative representations.

- **Output Layer**  
  Produces a score or decision vector indicating which papers to recommend.

## Dataset

The dataset includes metadata for each research paper:
- **Main Category**: The primary field of study.
- **Title**: Name of the paper.
- **Abstract**: Short description of the paper.
- **Link**: URL for accessing the full text.

## Future Enhancements

- **Citation-Based Ranking**: Improve paper selection using citation counts and impact metrics.
- **Personalized Suggestions**: Tailor recommendations using user profiles and browsing history.
- **Hybrid Techniques**: Combine DRL with collaborative filtering and content-based approaches.
