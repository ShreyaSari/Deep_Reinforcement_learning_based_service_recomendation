# Deep_Reinforcement_learning_based_service_recomendation
This work presents a recommendation system powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to suggest academic research papers aligned with user-specified core subjects. The model is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN), which enables it to determine the most suitable papers based on the user's selected topic of interest.
